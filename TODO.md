# TODO — warehouse-mfc

Single source of truth for open work. Milestones follow `docs/PLAN.md`.

## Done
- [x] **M0 — Database.** Schema + idempotent seed on LocalDB; `vCurrentStock` and
  `sp_RecordMovement` (IN / OUT / insufficient-stock THROW) verified.
- [x] **M1 — `core/` (pure C++, TDD).** `StockMath` (onHand, isLow); `Movement` +
  `compensating`; Command pattern (`ICommand`, `MovementCommand`, `CommandStack`);
  `VoiceCommandParser`. 48 assertions green (Debug + Release).
- [x] **M2 — `data/` (ODBC).** `StockRepository` (pImpl): `loadCurrentStock()`,
  `recordMovement()` (calls `sp_RecordMovement`, surfaces THROW as exception),
  implements `IMovementRecorder`. Verified by `tools/data_smoke`.

## Next
- [ ] **M3 — MFC UI.** SDI doc/view; `CMFCListCtrl` bound to `vCurrentStock` (low-stock
  rows owner-drawn red); Record-movement dialog (DDX/DDV); toolbar Refresh / IN / OUT /
  **Undo/Redo (Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y)**; low-stock filter. Wire `data/` through `core/` commands.
- [ ] **M4 — Voice (SAPI) + TTS.** Command-and-control grammar (PL) through the same
  `MovementCommand` path; TTS confirmation.
- [ ] **M5 — MSI.** Inno Setup; ensure seeded LocalDB on first run; note unsigned build.
- [ ] **M6 — Polish.** README screenshots + short screen recording; public-ready repo.

## Build / test (Windows)
```bash
# DB (once): sqlcmd -S "(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB" -i db\01_schema.sql ; ... -i db\02_seed.sql
msbuild warehouse-mfc.sln /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=x64
./x64/Debug/core_tests.exe     # unit tests (Catch2), exit 0 = green
./x64/Debug/data_smoke.exe     # data/ smoke check against LocalDB
```

## Notes for the next session
- Toolchain installed: VS 2022 Community + C++/MFC v143, SQL Server LocalDB 2022, sqlcmd
  (go-sqlcmd), ODBC Driver 17. Machine setup history (gitignored): `docs/WINDOWS_SETUP_LOG.md`.
- go-sqlcmd does **not** resolve `(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB` — connect via the named pipe
  (`SqlLocalDB.exe info MSSQLLocalDB`). The C++ ODBC layer resolves `(localdb)\` natively.
- DB product/warehouse IDs are **not** 1..N (IDENTITY climbed across re-seeds) — resolve
  ids from data (Sku/Code), never hardcode them.
